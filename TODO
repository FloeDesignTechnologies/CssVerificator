TODOS

. Finish the XML builder view

. In the verificators, instead of having the error messages hardcoded, put a message placeholder and put the error message in the locale files instead
    in the format:
    errors:
        too_many_css:
            html: "<b>There <i>are</i> too</b> many...  blah blah blah..."
            xml: too many css

. Do the JSON response format. right now, it crashes.


DONE
. Add some css of our own.  done by Jean-Fran√ßois Le Gac
